# Welcome 👋

This is a monorepo containing various survival analysis projects.
The main focus is on federated deep survival analysis.

# Run projects 🚀

We use PDM as a dependency manager. Additional steps can be found in project-level READMEs.

To install each project run:

```sh
pdm use 3.8 && pdm install
```

Tu run scripts that you would run with `python3` use:

```sh
pdm run <your script>
```

To run modules (e.g. scripts that you would run with `python3 -m`) use:

```sh
pdm run python3 -m <your script>
```
